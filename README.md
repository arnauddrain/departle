# Departle

A game about french departments, strongly inspired by [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/).

## Tech stack

This project doesn't use any framework or npm dependency.

I don't have anything against web frameworks, I just felt like they would add too much complexity here, especially with the SEO and the maintenance of the game.
